      <p>I've dedicated a major portion of my life to traveling and putting myself in situations guaranteeing my ability to travel. Besides a few trips to China in college, my first real "abroad" experience involved living in Seoul, South Korea for three years as an English teacher.
      <p>I have a lot of photos from Korea but here's one of my favorites, taken the second week I lived there while on the way to work - I like to call it "Statue in a Truck" :):</p>

      </br>

      <p>Between teaching contracts I also got to spend time traveling on my own, including travel to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Thailand</li>
        <li>Bangladesh</li>
        <li>India</li>
        <li>Nepal</li>
        <li>Japan</li>
        <li>Sweden (my sister lives there so I've spent LOTS of time there!)</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Later Years</h3>
    <p>Since finishing up and leaving Korea, I was fortunate to find a job in the US that included global travel. This includes travel to conferences and meetings for groups such as <a href="www.inshpo.org">INSHPO</a> in places like:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Turkey</li>
      <img width=300 class="listpics" src="IMG_0045[1].JPG">
    </br>
    </br>
      <li>Brazil</li>
      <img width=900 class="listpics" src="2011-11-11 18.43.50.jpg">
    </br>
    </br>
      <li>Russia</li>
      <img class="listpics" src="2012-07-09 03.25.56.jpg">
    </ul>

    <p> As well as (in no particular order):
      <ul>
        <li>England</li>
        <li>Germany</li>
        <li>Canada</li>
        <li>Mexico</li>
        <li>Jamaica</li>
        <li>Finland</li>
        <li>Latvia</li>
        <li>Estonia</li>
        <li>Australia</li>
        <li>China</li>
        <li>AND finally, North Korea! (I know, what?!?!?) Here's proof:</li>
        <img class="listpics" src="North Korea.jpg">
      </ul>
    <p>Where do I want to go next? My next "dream" vacation would be either to go to Patagonia or South Africa. Or both!

    <p>The End!
